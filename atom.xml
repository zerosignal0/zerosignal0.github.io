    <id>http://zerosignal0.github.io/blog/2014/06/03/python-introduction-to-recursion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been asked recently to write up a description on recursion in regards to python recursive functions.  I figured this is a topic that generally confuses most engineers that I work with and is probably worthy of a quick blog post.</p>

<br><br><br>


<p><b>So first of all what is recursion?</b></p>

<p>Recursive functions are functions that call themselves in their definition. Because a recursive function calls on itself to perform its task, it can make jobs that contain identical work on multiple data objects easier to conceptualize, plan and write.  Recursion can also be quite taxing on the server in which it is being ran and also has limitations which can sometimes cause issues in the future.  For example recursive functions, by default, Windows has a recursion limit of 1000 (as does OSX).  Linux, depending on the flavor, can range but generally is 2147483647 (2<sup>31</sup> &ndash; 1).</p>

<p><b>*note to determine the value set on your system, open your python interpreter and run the following:</b></p>

<br><br>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>determine recursion limit</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">Import</span> <span class="n">sys</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getrecursionlimit</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<br><br>


<p>Another thing to consider when writing a recursive function is that, recursion is indeed the best approach.  I have seen instances where introduction can actually cause code complication along with poor performance vs. other design patterns.</p>

<br><br>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>simple example</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">some_func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">some_func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">z</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<br><br>


<p>Now the above example has an obvious issue in the fact that it never returns which causes a loop.  This loop will continue to iterate until it reaches the system set limitation (as described previously).  If you were to run the above code the end result would be the following snippet.</p>

<br><br>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>simple example output</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<br><br><br>


<p><b>Intro to base cases</b></p>

<p>To avoid the previous example of recursion running uncontrollably until reaching the limits of the system, we have conditionals which are required to properly gate recursion.  This means that functions that make use of recursion require conditions to be satisfied in order to either <b>continue to recursively call itself</b> or <b>return</b>.  The common conditionals used are if/else.</p>

<br><br><br>


<p><b>Example recursion code snippet</b></p>

<br>


<p>The most common example to describe usage of recursion is within the factoring of factorial for a given number.  In the spirit of this, I am going to provide a code example of using recursion to determine the factorial for a given number.  As a quick explanation, if your unfamiliar with factorials. A factorial is a product of multiplication: the number resulting from multiplying a whole number by every whole number between itself and 1 inclusive.  (n!, or n * n-1 * n-2 &hellip; 0).</p>

    <id>http://zerosignal0.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/python-how-to-init-a-function-by-calling-it-using-a-string</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This topic is an interesting one that I have faced on a few occasions.  There are a couple of different solution that I have found over the last couple of years that work depending on the situation.  So let&rsquo;s back up again and state the problem in the form of a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you call a function in python guven a string of the functions name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Generally this behavior is not allowed due to the strict type casting of python, ie. a function must be a function type before being able to call.  So how do you approach calling a function by using a string? *note that both of these examples are assuming that the functions being called are residing within imported modules.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p>

<p>1.)  Use the getattr() built-in function to evaluate a module object and provide a string attribute denoting the name of the function to execute.
<b>*note This method is generally frowned upon as using getattr and eval are both possibly dangerous built in functions that can lead to security issues / unexpected results.<b></p>

<p>  example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>simple_example</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">foo</span> <span class="c"># Your module</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">methodCall</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">methodCall</span><span class="p">()</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>2.) You can also write an abstract function capable of evaluating the string provided in a function object, and also evaluate if the function exists in a graceful way.
This approach is a bit more complex and makes use of a couple of different modules, along with leveraging decorator functions.</p>

<p>  example:</p>

<p>  <b>Place this code into a importable module file called registry.py</b></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>registry.py</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Registry</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>  <b>Now create a file that contains your functions you wish to call.  In this example call this file myfuncs.py</b></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>myfuncs.py</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>  <b>Finally here is the script that will create the string in which we will attempt to execute as a function.</b></p>

<p>As you can see example 2 is quite a bit more involved however can scale to supporting MANY different function template files.  This means that you can further abstract your code into a template language to dynamically import with.</p>

    <link href="http://zerosignal0.github.io/blog/2014/05/25/messaging-queue-showdown-amazon-sqs-vs-celery-rabbitmq/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-25T19:58:12+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://zerosignal0.github.io/blog/2014/05/25/messaging-queue-showdown-amazon-sqs-vs-celery-rabbitmq</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I am a previous engineer at Amazon AWS I have plenty of experience with AWS services and have exclusively leveraged SQS in many projects.  I have always had a mostly positive experience with Amazon AWS SQS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a> however I have been curious for quite some time what the benefit of rabbitMQ <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">http://www.rabbitmq.com/</a> could be vs. SQS. Message queuing is not a new concept and has existed for years within computer science/engineering see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue</a> if you are unfamiliar with the concept.</p>

<p>*I would like to firstly point out that my experiences with both services have been with Python, however I did create a test instance and performed the same tests with Java yielding the same results.</p>

<p>So I have to start out by saying that Amazons offering for queuing services is fantastic, relatively cheap and easy.  The community has also built some fantastic programmatic libraries to interact with the web services.  So now you may ask, why look at other services?  Well there can be some possible drawbacks of SQS as well that can cause you some problems depending on the situation.</p>

<p>One drawback of SQS implementation is the need for polling of a message queue to determine if new messages have appeared.  This is a bit of an issue being as you must now model your application to perform a polling cycle in order to determine if new messages are available, and if so build the logic around consuming the message and popping it out of the queue.  You must also be mindful of queue settings that control such things as TTL, maximum message length and which endpoints (if multiple are used) the message is destined for.</p>

<p>Beyond the small issue of having to be responsible for your own polling cycle, you are also billed based upon the number of requests to a queue.  I believe the breakdown on billing is something along the lines of 1 million requests == $100.00.  While this isn’t a ton of money it can still get quite costly if your distributed app has 100s of queue and must all be polled.  Especially if your messages come in bursts, in which case you have a lot of empty queue polling which penalizes you. There are different approaches you can take with SQS to apply back-off algorithms to queuing logic, but the penalty is delay in all other inter-dependent services cascades.</p>

<p>So now enter RabbitMQ.</p>

<p>RabbitMQ is a message queue system based on Erlang and conforming to AMQP (a standard and heavily used message queue protocol).  There are obvious overhead in the fact that you must host your own instances of RabbitMQ along with the infrastructure.  Also obvious reliability in multi-AZ redundancy will need to be considered unless you continue to host your instance within EC2 and configure appropriately.</p>

<p>So now lets talk about the speed of RabbitMQ, I have one word to describe it.  FAST! My testing was performed within Amazon EC2 / AWS within the same region|AZ to be fair.  My test was simple, build a queue, spray 5,000 message to the queue as fast as possible, de-queue and discard message.   There are many different configurations  that RabbitMQ can support such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, RPC.  In my example I simply used the default which is one-to-one.</p>

<p>So now the “quarter mile” times between the two.</p>

<p>Amazon AWS SQS: <br>
Region: <b>IAD</b><br>
Service: <b>SQS</b><br>
Total time: <b>5:42 minutes:seconds</b><br></p>

<p>RabbitMQ EC2:<br>
Region: <b>IAD</b><br>
Service: <b>EC2</b><br>
Total time: <b>0:06 minutes:seconds</b><br></p>

<p>What does this prove!?!</p>

<p>Nothing really besides shoving a lot of messages down the pipe and pulling them out on the other side IS indeed faster using RabbitMQ.  This does not prove however that the actual service is “better” than SQS by any stretch of the imagination.  Both services provide pro/con, and SQS has a rich history of reliable service that affords a great mixture of safe queuing along with a rock solid infrastructure.</p>

<p>On the other hand depending on the configuration of RabbitMQ you can gain a lot of these safeties with seemingly smaller hit in performance in terms of delivery times.  I hope to revisit this topic once I have more time to spend, hopefully this helps educate anyone that is posed with approaching these services in the future though.</p>

Normally this wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge deal except for the systems are states away from eachother with less than reliable throughput and no option for scalable cloud solutions.  I did however have another host in close proximity that was capable of hosting a REDIS based server for me to read/write to.  I have worked with REDIS once before but this experience has been AWESOME so far!  Key/Data stores are one thing but the speed of this technology, when implemented correctly, blows my mind every time.
