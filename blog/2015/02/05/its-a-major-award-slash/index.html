<p>It has been a wild few months since moving back here to the great PNW.   Something that recently happened is obtaining an award for a recent join patent that I filed with a couple of close friends / engineers at Microsoft back in October.  The patent is based on a concept of flexible vm disk images, which would incorporate a layer of metadata to describe the different configuration standards in which to be used, however do away with the need to store those individual images directly on disk.  This would also in turn mean that you can speed up your deployments easily, without the extra overhead.</p>
