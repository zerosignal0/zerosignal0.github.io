    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In working on a project I was having some issues with storing data with a MySQL server that required many read/writes.  Normally this wouldn&rsquo;t be a huge deal except for the systems are states away from eachother with less than reliable throughput and no option for scalable cloud solutions.  I did however have another host in close proximity that was capable of hosting a REDIS based server for me to read/write to.  I have worked with REDIS once before but this experience has been AWESOME so far!  Key/Data stores are one thing but the speed of this technology, when implemented correctly, blows my mind every time.  If you haven&rsquo;t had the chance to work with REDIS you should give it a try, here is a AWESOME interactive demo <a href="http://try.redis.io/">http://try.redis.io/</a></p>
